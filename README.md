## Purpose:
To meet the project requirements stated in Instruction folder and to help job seekers have a glimpse of the job market and payscale, I choose to do web scraping on two websites for specific job(s) in specific location(s), and analyzing these data in relation to government employment dataset by occupation, state, and year.

## Workflow Process
* Scrape websites, "https://www.indeed.com" and "https://www.itsmycareer.com", for current jobs and save each webpage as html file
* Read each html file, format, and store data into MongoDB job database
* Download excel file from "https://www.bls.gov" for employment by occupation and state
* Read the excel files into dataframe, clean, format and merge with US population by state, and load to job database
* Select the desired columns from MongoDB and read back to dataframe for analysis
* Save result dataset into excel sheet in Output directory

## :warning: Important Notes
* If the scraping web urls (itsmycareer & indeed) changed, code in the three .py scripts need to be updated.
